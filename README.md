Digital mammography is currently the most effective way to screen for breast cancer and is increasingly replacing traditional methods as the gold standard in the diagnostic and screening process (Schulz- Wendtland, 2009). However, the low positive predictive value of digital mammography caused by mammogram interpretation result in around 70% non-essential biopsies with benign masses (Elter, M., 2007). So computer-aided diagnosis systems were used to support medical professionals for a long time. Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) is one of the quality assurance tools use with mammography and standardize report. It is meaningful to identify the severity of mammography masses to decrease a large number of non-essential biopsies.
